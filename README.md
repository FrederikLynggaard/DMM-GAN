# DMM-GAN: Global-Local Dynamic Memory and Redescription Objective for Direct Text-to-Image Synthesis using Fine-Grained Data

This is the repository containing the code for our masterâ€™s thesis. We study three multi-stage GANs: AttnGAN, MirrorGAN, DM-GAN, and contribute with the fusion of key ideas from these methods. Our final proposed model is called Dynamic Memory Mirrored Generative Adversarial Network (DMM-GAN). The DMM-GAN architecture is best illustrated via its modifications made in relation to AttnGAN. Figure 1 and Figure 2 together illustrate these modifications.


## Figure 1 (AttnGAN)

An overview of the AttnGAN architecture. This architecture is fundamental for DMM-GAN. At its core, AttnGAN is a multi-stage generative refinement network that utilizes word-level information between stages via an attention mechanism. The generated bird images are taken directly from the original paper.

## Figure 2  (DMM-GAN)
<img src="DMM-GAN.png" width="900px"/>
An overview of our DMM-GAN architecture in relation to AttnGAN. This figure illustrates DMM-GAN's additions/changes (green) and removed parts (red). For this method, the DAMSM loss is replaced by the Semantic Text REgeneration and Alignment Module (STREAM), which is used to produce a caption redescription loss. The DAMSM image encoder is therefore removed, since STREAM contains its own image encoder. Furthermore, attention mechanisms are replaced by global-local dynamic memory mechanisms (GLDM), and as a result, hidden image features are no longer passed directly to next stages. The joining operation is therefore not needed. <br /><br />


The details of STREAM and GLDM are shown in the following illustrations.
